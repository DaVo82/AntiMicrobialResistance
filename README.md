This project creates an interactive html table which shows the German part of the estimates of the burden of antimicrobial resistance 
by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).
Please respect the IHME license terms for any use (https://www.healthdata.org/Data-tools-practices/data-practices/ihme-free-charge-non-commercial-user-agreement).
My work on this data serves as a personal exercise and is intended as a contribution to the RStudio table contest. 
It does not constitute medical research and is not to be used as such.
